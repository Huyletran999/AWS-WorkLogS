**On this page**, you will need to introduce your worklog. **How** did you complete it? How many weeks did you take to complete the program? **What** did you do in those weeks?

Typically, and as a standard, a worklog is carried out over about 3 months (throughout the internship period) with weekly contents as follows:

**Week 1:** [Familiarized with the working environment and AWS fundamentals by setting up the account, completing core VPC and EC2 labs, and establishing the Hugo documentation site.](1.1-week1/)

**Week 2:** [Deepened networking and storage expertise by configuring AWS Transit Gateway, hosting static websites on S3, and implementing data backup and recovery strategies.](1.2-week2/)

**Week 3:** [Focused on strengthening security posture through IAM, KMS, and AWS Organizations, while advancing operational capabilities with Amazon FSx and Lambda automation.](1.3-week3/)

**Week 4:** [Explored AWS database services and successfully migrated a custom MSSQL database to MySQL using the Schema Conversion Tool, alongside formulating the team workshop proposal.](1.4-week4/)

**Week 5:** [Advanced the workshop proposal by refining the architecture and Lambda algorithms, while mastering data streaming and analytics pipelines using Amazon Kinesis, Glue, and Athena.](1.5-week5/)

**Week 6:** [Finalized the workshop proposal and architecture by integrating Amazon GuardDuty and EventBridge, and deployed the updated documentation to GitHub Pages.](1.6-week6/)

**Week 7:** [Prototyped the automated incident response workflow by integrating GuardDuty with EventBridge for notification and remediation, while enhancing the architecture .](1.7-week7/)

**Week 8:** [Dedicated the week to mastering AWS core concepts for the midterm exam while refining the project architecture with AWS Step Functions and EC2 isolation logic.](1.8-week8/)

**Week 9:** [Refined the architecture by adopting AWS Step Functions for orchestration and implementing a serverless ETL pipeline to process CloudTrail logs for the custom dashboard.](1.9-week9/)

**Week 10:** [Validated the automated response logic by deploying the AWS Step Functions workflow, debugging Lambda parsers against real GuardDuty findings, and enforcing least-privilege security controls.](1.10-week10/)

**Week 11:** [Optimized architectural reliability by integrating Amazon SQS and prepared for the Infrastructure as Code transition using AWS CDK, while strengthening edge security knowledge through AWS WAF and CloudFront.](1.11-week11/)

**Week 12:** [Transitioned to Infrastructure as Code by initializing the AWS CDK environment and enhanced the incident response workflow with automated forensics collection.](1.12-week12/)
