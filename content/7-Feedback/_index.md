### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**
The working atmosphere at FCJ is remarkably welcoming and open. Members are consistently willing to offer support whenever I face technical challenges, often extending their help beyond standard working hours. The workspace is well-organized and comfortable, which significantly aids my concentration. However, I believe increasing the frequency of social gatherings or team bonding activities would be beneficial to further strengthen team cohesion.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
My mentor provided exceptional guidance—offering clear explanations for complex concepts while encouraging a culture of inquiry. I particularly value the pedagogical approach where I was encouraged to attempt solving problems independently before receiving the final solution, which greatly enhanced my critical thinking. Additionally, the admin team was instrumental in handling administrative tasks and providing necessary documentation, creating favorable conditions for a seamless workflow.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**
The assigned tasks were highly relevant to my university curriculum, effectively bridging the gap between academic theory and practical application. Beyond reinforcing foundational knowledge, the internship introduced me to advanced domains I had not previously encountered (such as Cloud Security automation), allowing me to expand my skillset significantly.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**
Throughout this internship, I have acquired a diverse set of skills, ranging from proficiency in project management tools to professional communication within a corporate setting. Furthermore, the real-world experiences and career advice shared by my mentor have been invaluable in helping me shape my future career path in Cloud Engineering.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**
The company culture strikes a perfect balance between professionalism and approachability. Mutual respect is evident, and while work is taken seriously, the atmosphere remains enjoyable. I was particularly impressed by the collective spirit during urgent projects, where everyone, regardless of position, collaborated to support one another. This inclusivity made me feel like a true member of the team, not just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**
The internship program offers practical benefits, including a fair flexible working hours when necessary. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in internal training sessions is a significant advantage that demonstrates the company's investment in talent development.

### Additional Questions

**What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**
The most satisfying moment was successfully deploying the **Autonomous Incident Response** system using AWS Step Functions without relying on intermediate Lambda functions. Seeing the system automatically detect, isolate, and snapshot an instance in a real-world scenario gave me a profound sense of accomplishment and validated the technical skills I had learned.

**What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**
While the technical guidance is excellent, I believe having a more structured orientation regarding **professional conduct and organizational discipline** in the first week would be beneficial. This would help interns better adapt to the company's internal regulations and workflow standards right from the start.

**If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**
I would definitely recommend interning here. This environment allows you to get your hands dirty with real cloud infrastructure rather than just observing. The mentorship is supportive but challenging enough to force you to grow, which is ideal for anyone serious about a career in DevOps or Cloud Security.

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
I suggest incorporating weekly or bi-weekly "Lightning Talk" sessions where interns can present what they learned or the bugs they fixed that week. This would improve our presentation skills and allow for cross-learning between different teams.

**Would you like to continue this program in the future?**
Yes, absolutely. I am very keen on continuing to contribute to the company, potentially in an advanced internship role or a fresher position, to further develop the automation IR projects I have started.

**Any other comments (free sharing):**
I want to express my sincere gratitude to the mentors and the FCJ team for their patience and dedication. This internship has not only improved my technical coding skills but also matured my mindset regarding system architecture and professional responsibility.
